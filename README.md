OOP Python cross road game with turtle PHP form skretch

Today was a challenge for me.
Because today I needed to make the Game entirely from scretch
using the Turtle module
and I didn't want to use any given hints. Just me, `Pycharm` an `Goodle`.
So here is the result.

So the game rules are that the turtle needs to cross the road without colliding with cars.
So I thought I will need the `player class` and the `car class that 'rules' the cars`.
Also, I will need some `score holding class` to handle the score
and surely I will need the `main.py` to compose it all together
